## Case 1: Botnia Pulp Mill Dispute

**Countries**: Argentina vs. Uruguay  
**Years**: 2003-2010  
**Phenotypic Expression Score**: 4  
**Institutional Outcome**: 0 (Globalist victory - ICJ ruled for Uruguay)  
**Sovereignty Phenotype**: 0.70  
**Globalism Phenotype**: 0.40

### Background and Context

The Botnia dispute originated when Finnish company Botnia Oy announced plans in 2003 to construct a large pulp mill in Fray Bentos, Uruguay, on the Uruguay River shared with Argentina. Argentine citizens in the border town of Gualeguaychú organized mass protests, claiming the mill would cause transboundary pollution. The conflict escalated into:

- **Semi-permanent bridge blockades** (2005-2009) disrupting bilateral trade and tourism
- **ICJ litigation** (2006-2010) with both countries accepting the Court's compulsory jurisdiction
- **Presidential confrontations** at MERCOSUR summits
- **World Bank involvement** through IFC financing ($170 million loan)

The case became the paradigmatic example of **Extended Phenotype competition** in South America, pitting:
- **Argentine sovereigntism**: Right to protect environment and reject foreign corporate projects
- **Globalist frameworks**: ICJ jurisdiction, World Bank standards, MERCOSUR free transit obligations

### Phenotypic Competition Dynamics

**Sovereigntist Phenotypes** (Argentina):
1. **Physical artifacts**: Bridge blockades at Gualeguaychú-Fray Bentos international bridge
2. **Judicial artifacts**: Argentine Federal Court injunctions (attempted)
3. **Legislative artifacts**: Argentine Senate resolutions urging mill suspension
4. **Symbolic artifacts**: Presidential rhetoric (Kirchner), mass protests (100,000+ participants)
5. **Organizational artifacts**: AFOA (Argentine Federation of Environmental Organizations) formation

**Globalist Phenotypes** (Uruguay + International Institutions):
1. **Judicial artifacts**: ICJ jurisdiction acceptance, ICJ provisional measures, final ICJ judgment (April 20, 2009)
2. **Financial artifacts**: World Bank/IFC loan approval and disbursement
3. **Treaty artifacts**: 1975 Uruguay River Statute, MERCOSUR Treaty of Asunción (1991)
4. **Regulatory artifacts**: Finnish environmental standards, EU pulp mill regulations
5. **Monitoring artifacts**: IFC Compliance Advisor Ombudsman (CAO), binational scientific commissions

**Peak Competition** (2007-2008):
- Mill under construction despite Argentine protests
- ICJ hearings ongoing
- Bridge blockades at maximum intensity
- Both presidents (Kirchner, Vázquez) mobilizing domestic constituencies

### Selection Pressures

1. **Economic Crisis (Uruguay)**: 2002 financial collapse created pressure for development projects like Botnia; unemployment in Fray Bentos region exceeded 25%

2. **Environmental Movement (Argentina)**: Post-2001 crisis saw rise of social movements rejecting neoliberal globalization; Botnia became symbol of "foreign corporate imperialism"

3. **MERCOSUR Integration**: Regional integration commitments (free transit, dispute resolution) created institutional constraints on both countries

4. **ICJ Jurisdiction**: Both countries' historical commitment to international law (reflected in ICJ Statute acceptance) limited unilateral actions

### Outcome and Institutional Fitness

**ICJ Judgment (April 20, 2009)**:
- **Uruguay violated procedural obligations** under 1975 Statute (inadequate consultation)
- **No substantive violations**: Mill did not cause significant transboundary pollution
- **No remedies ordered**: Mill allowed to continue operations
- **Argentina not responsible** for bridge blockades (civil society actions)

**Institutional Consequences**:
- **Globalist survival**: ICJ jurisdiction upheld; mill operates legally
- **Sovereigntist adaptation**: Binational monitoring commission established (Argentine demand partially met)
- **Memeplex coexistence**: Neither full victory; stable institutional equilibrium

**Fitness Indicators**:
- **Mill continues operations** (2010-present): Globalist phenotype survives
- **Binational commission institutionalized**: Sovereigntist concerns incorporated into monitoring regime
- **No similar disputes** in subsequent 15 years: Institutional learning/adaptation

### Theoretical Significance

**Extended Phenotype Dynamics**:
1. **Observable artifacts**: Clear institutional manifestations of competing memeplexes
2. **Selection pressures**: Economic crises (Uruguay), environmental mobilization (Argentina), regional integration commitments
3. **Fitness costs**: Economic losses (Uruguay tourism -$300M), political capital expended, litigation costs
4. **Adaptive outcomes**: Binational commission represents memeplex mixing; neither achieves fixation

**Botnia as Paradigmatic Case**:
- **Inspired this research project**: Author's firsthand experience as AFOA Vice President (2005-2008)
- **High phenotypic expression** (score = 4): Clear, sustained, high-salience institutional competition
- **Mixed outcome**: Demonstrates real-world complexity; neither pure Sovereigntist nor pure Globalist victory
- **Diffusion effects**: Influenced subsequent Latin American treaty disputes (ICSID withdrawals, UNASUR court proposals)

## Case 2: Brexit

**Country**: United Kingdom  
**Years**: 2016-2020  
**Phenotypic Expression Score**: 5  
**Institutional Outcome**: 1 (Sovereigntist victory)  
**Sovereignty Phenotype**: 0.95  
**Globalism Phenotype**: 0.10

### Background and Context

Brexit represents the most significant instance of **institutional exit** from a supranational organization in modern history. The UK's 47-year membership in the European Economic Community (EEC, 1973) and European Union (EU, 1993-2020) ended following:

- **Referendum** (June 23, 2016): 51.9% voted "Leave"
- **Article 50 trigger** (March 29, 2017): Formal notification of withdrawal
- **Withdrawal negotiations** (2017-2019): Three-year contentious process
- **Official exit** (January 31, 2020): UK formally left EU

The case exhibits **maximum phenotypic expression** (score = 5) due to:
- Global scope and political salience
- Complete institutional rupture (not mere treaty renegotiation)
- Sustained four-year competition (2016-2020)
- Profound institutional consequences (ongoing as of 2025)

### Phenotypic Competition Dynamics

**Sovereigntist Phenotypes** (Leave Campaign + UK Government post-2016):
1. **Electoral artifacts**: Referendum result (17.4M "Leave" votes)
2. **Legislative artifacts**: European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020
3. **Constitutional artifacts**: UK Supreme Court rulings (e.g., *Miller* cases on parliamentary sovereignty)
4. **Symbolic artifacts**: "Take Back Control" slogan, Boris Johnson's rhetoric, immigration restrictions
5. **Institutional exits**: Withdrawal from EU Single Market, Customs Union, CJEU jurisdiction, Europol, Euratom

**Globalist Phenotypes** (Remain Campaign + EU Institutions):
1. **Judicial artifacts**: CJEU rulings (e.g., *Wightman* case on Article 50 revocability)
2. **Treaty artifacts**: Article 50 TEU process, Withdrawal Agreement, Northern Ireland Protocol
3. **Regulatory artifacts**: EU acquis (~20,000 laws retained initially), regulatory alignment provisions
4. **Economic artifacts**: Single Market access, free movement of people/capital/goods/services
5. **Organizational artifacts**: Remain campaigns, People's Vote movement, parliamentary opposition

**Peak Competition** (2017-2019):
- Three Prime Ministers (Cameron resigned, May struggled, Johnson delivered Brexit)
- Two general elections (2017, 2019) fought on Brexit
- Parliamentary gridlock (May's deal rejected 3 times)
- Mass protests (1 million+ marchers in London, October 2018)
- Supreme Court intervention (*Miller II*, prorogation unlawful)

### Selection Pressures

1. **Immigration Crisis (2015-2016)**: Syrian refugee crisis; media focus on EU free movement; UKIP electoral gains

2. **Economic Stagnation**: Post-2008 austerity; stagnant wages for working class; EU perceived as neoliberal elite project

3. **Sovereignty Narrative**: 40+ years of tabloid Euroscepticism ("Brussels diktats"); resonance with English nationalism

4. **Conservative Party Internal Politics**: Cameron's gamble to unify party and neutralize UKIP threat backfired

### Outcome and Institutional Fitness

**Brexit Outcomes** (as of 2025):
- **Complete exit** from EU institutions (Single Market, Customs Union, CJEU)
- **Trade and Cooperation Agreement** (TCA, 2020): Governs post-Brexit UK-EU relations; zero tariffs but significant non-tariff barriers
- **Northern Ireland Protocol**: Special status to avoid hard border; ongoing tensions (DUP opposition, EU renegotiations)
- **Economic impacts**: GDP ~4% lower than pre-Brexit trajectory (OBR estimates); trade friction; City of London loses EU passporting

**Institutional Fitness**:
- **Sovereigntist victory**: UK Parliament supreme; no CJEU jurisdiction; independent trade policy
- **Globalist adaptation**: EU loses member but survives; no domino effect (no other exits); EU integration deepens (e.g., Recovery Fund 2020)
- **Hybrid arrangements**: TCA represents neither full exit nor membership; ongoing institutional negotiations

### Theoretical Significance

**Extended Phenotype Dynamics**:
1. **Maximum phenotypic expression**: Score = 5 reflects global scope, high salience, complete institutional rupture
2. **Memetic diffusion**: Brexit inspired sovereigntist movements globally (Italy's Lega, France's RN, US Trump administration)
3. **Selection pressure response**: EU adaptation includes stronger external border control (Frontex expansion), fiscal integration (Recovery Fund)
4. **Fitness costs**: UK economic contraction; EU loses budget contributor and military power; but both institutions survive

**Brexit as Memetic Watershed**:
- **Sovereigntist legitimation**: Demonstrated that exit from supranational integration is feasible (previously unthinkable)
- **Globalist resilience**: EU cohesion maintained; no cascade of exits; "Brexit effect" deterred Eurosceptics elsewhere (e.g., Italy's 5-Star Movement, France's RN moderated positions)
- **Institutional evolution**: Post-Brexit EU reformed (Conference on the Future of Europe 2021-2022) to address democratic deficit concerns

**Comparison to Botnia**:
- Both cases involve **competing institutional jurisdictions** (national vs. supranational)
- Brexit achieves **full Sovereigntist victory** (Phenotype = 0.95) vs. Botnia's **mixed outcome** (Phenotype = 0.70)
- Brexit's **global scope** (score = 1.0) vs. Botnia's **regional scope** (score = 0.67)
- Both demonstrate **high political salience** (mass mobilization, media saturation)

## Case 3: Poland Judicial Reforms

**Country**: Poland  
**Years**: 2015-2023  
**Phenotypic Expression Score**: 4  
**Institutional Outcome**: 1 (Sovereigntist victory, but contested)  
**Sovereignty Phenotype**: 0.80  
**Globalism Phenotype**: 0.25

### Background and Context

Poland's judicial reforms under the Law and Justice Party (PiS, *Prawo i Sprawiedliwość*) represent the most sustained challenge to EU rule of law norms since the Union's founding. Beginning in 2015, PiS government implemented:

- **Constitutional Tribunal restructuring** (2015-2016): Changed composition to install loyalist judges
- **Supreme Court retirement age lowering** (2017): Forced retirement of independent judges
- **Disciplinary regime for judges** (2019): Created system allowing government to sanction judges for rulings
- **Judicial appointment mechanisms** (2017-2023): National Judicial Council (KRS) politicized; government gains control over judge appointments

The reforms triggered **Article 7 TEU proceedings** (first time in EU history), **CJEU lawsuits**, **EU budget conditionality mechanisms**, and **ongoing EU-Poland institutional conflict** as of 2025.

### Phenotypic Competition Dynamics

**Sovereigntist Phenotypes** (PiS Government):
1. **Legislative artifacts**: 12+ laws restructuring judiciary (2015-2021)
2. **Constitutional artifacts**: Constitutional Tribunal rulings asserting Polish law supremacy over EU law (October 2021 decision)
3. **Symbolic artifacts**: PiS rhetoric ("We will not bow to Brussels"; "Polish sovereignty")
4. **Judicial artifacts**: Disciplinary Chamber of Supreme Court (sanctioning independent judges)
5. **Organizational artifacts**: Politicized National Judicial Council (KRS)

**Globalist Phenotypes** (EU Institutions + Polish Opposition):
1. **Judicial artifacts**: CJEU rulings declaring Polish reforms violate EU law (*Commission v. Poland*, 2019, 2021)
2. **Financial artifacts**: EU budget conditionality mechanism; €36 billion Recovery Fund frozen (2021-2024)
3. **Treaty artifacts**: Article 7 TEU proceedings (rule of law mechanism)
4. **Organizational artifacts**: European Commission infringement procedures, Venice Commission opinions
5. **Symbolic artifacts**: Mass protests in Warsaw (50,000+ participants, 2017-2021), KOD (Committee for the Defense of Democracy)

**Peak Competition** (2021-2022):
- Polish Constitutional Tribunal rules **EU law supremacy challenged** (October 7, 2021)
- CJEU imposes **€1 million/day fines** on Poland (October 2021)
- EU freezes **€36 billion Recovery Fund** payments (2021-2023)
- PiS threatens **"Polexit"** (implicit), though public opposition (70%+ pro-EU) makes exit politically infeasible

### Selection Pressures

1. **Post-Communist Transition**: PiS narrative portrays judicial elites as remnants of communist regime; reforms frame as "de-communization"

2. **Electoral Mandate**: PiS won elections (2015, 2019) on platform including judicial reform; democratic legitimacy claim

3. **EU Enlargement Paradox**: Poland joined EU (2004) to "return to Europe," but PiS exploits sovereignty concerns among conservative voters

4. **Refugee Crisis (2015)**: EU migration quotas unpopular in Poland; PiS leverages to build anti-Brussels sentiment

### Outcome and Institutional Fitness

**Current Status** (as of 2023):
- **Judicial reforms largely implemented**: Constitutional Tribunal controlled; Supreme Court disciplinary regime operational; KRS politicized
- **EU sanctions imposed**: CJEU fines accumulating (€1M/day since Oct 2021); Recovery Fund frozen
- **October 2023 Election**: Opposition coalition (Civic Coalition, Third Way, Left) defeats PiS; new government (Donald Tusk) commits to reversing reforms and restoring judicial independence
- **Institutional uncertainty**: Reversal process complex; PiS-appointed judges entrenched; Constitutional Tribunal may block reforms

**Institutional Fitness**:
- **Sovereigntist victory (2015-2023)**: PiS restructured judiciary; defied CJEU; maintained domestic control
- **Globalist resilience**: EU sanctions eventually pressured Poland (economic costs); 2023 election outcome represents delayed Globalist institutional response
- **Ongoing competition**: Post-2023 reversal efforts face sovereigntist resistance; Constitutional Tribunal challenges reforms

### Theoretical Significance

**Extended Phenotype Dynamics**:
1. **Sustained competition**: 8-year conflict (2015-2023) demonstrates long-term institutional competition
2. **Selection pressure timing**: Economic pressure (frozen funds) required years to produce institutional response (2023 election)
3. **Institutional inertia**: PiS-appointed judges remain; full reversal may require decade+
4. **Memetic diffusion**: Poland's "rule of law crisis" inspired similar concerns re: Hungary, Romania; EU developed new conditionality mechanisms (applicable to all member states)

**Poland vs. Brexit Comparison**:
- **Poland remains in EU** (public support 70%+) vs. UK exit (narrow majority)
- **Institutional consequences less severe**: Reforms vs. exit, but both challenge supranational authority
- **Economic leverage matters**: Frozen Recovery Fund (€36B) represents 18% of Polish GDP; significant selection pressure
- **Both cases exhibit high Sovereignty Phenotype** (Poland = 0.80, UK = 0.95)

**Theoretical Implications**:
- **Institutional competition can occur within membership**: Exit not necessary for sovereigntist phenotypic expression
- **Economic interdependence creates limits**: Poland's EU budget dependence (net recipient) constrains pure sovereigntism
- **Democratic selection pressures**: 2023 election demonstrates public can reverse sovereigntist institutional changes

## Case 4: Greece Bailout Referendum

**Country**: Greece  
**Years**: 2015  
**Phenotypic Expression Score**: 3  
**Institutional Outcome**: 0 (Globalist victory)  
**Sovereignty Phenotype**: 0.35  
**Globalism Phenotype**: 0.75

### Background and Context

In June 2015, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras called a referendum on EU/IMF bailout terms. The "Oxi" (No) vote won 61.3%, rejecting austerity conditions. Despite this democratic mandate, Tsipras's government accepted even harsher bailout terms one week later, illustrating the **limits of sovereigntist mobilization** under economic dependency.

### Phenotypic Competition Dynamics

**Sovereigntist**: Referendum (constitutional artifact), Syriza's anti-austerity platform, mass protests, "democracy vs. technocracy" framing.

**Globalist**: Troika (EC, ECB, IMF) ultimatum, capital controls threat, bank run risks, euro exit costs.

**Peak Competition**: July 5-13, 2015 (referendum to bailout acceptance).

### Selection Pressures

1. **Economic Collapse**: Banks closed, ATM withdrawals limited to €60/day
2. **Euro Membership Value**: Grexit costs (currency devaluation, inflation) exceeded austerity costs
3. **Political Isolation**: No EU allies supported Greece; even left-wing governments (Portugal, Spain) sided with creditors

### Outcome and Institutional Fitness

**Globalist Victory**: Third bailout (€86B) accepted; austerity implemented; Tsipras reversed campaign promises.

**Fitness**: Globalist institutional power (ECB, EU) demonstrated supremacy over national democratic mandates when economic leverage exists.

### Theoretical Significance

Demonstrates **economic interdependence as selection pressure**: Sovereigntist memeplex cannot survive without financial autonomy. Contrasts with Brexit (UK had economic cushion) and Poland (EU funds frozen but economy stable).

## Case 5: Venezuela ICSID Withdrawal

**Country**: Venezuela  
**Years**: 2012  
**Phenotypic Expression Score**: 4  
**Institutional Outcome**: 1 (Sovereigntist victory)  
**Sovereignty Phenotype**: 0.85  
**Globalism Phenotype**: 0.20

### Background and Context

Venezuela formally denounced the ICSID Convention (World Bank investment arbitration system) on January 24, 2012, effective July 25, 2012. President Hugo Chávez framed withdrawal as reclaiming sovereignty over natural resources (oil, mining) from "imperialist tribunals."

### Phenotypic Competition Dynamics

**Sovereigntist**: Withdrawal decree, constitutional reforms (2009 prohibiting international arbitration of public law disputes), nationalization of oil/mining sectors (2007-2012), Chávez's rhetoric ("economic sovereignty").

**Globalist**: 23 pending ICSID cases (totaling $30B+ claims), bilateral investment treaties (BITs) with sunset clauses (continued ICSID jurisdiction for 15 years), international investor pressure.

### Selection Pressures

1. **Resource Nationalism**: Post-2003 oil strike; Chávez consolidated control over PDVSA (state oil company)
2. **ICSID Awards Against Venezuela**: $908M award to ExxonMobil (2007), other pending mega-claims
3. **Bolivarian Ideology**: "21st Century Socialism" memeplex incompatible with investor protections

### Outcome and Institutional Fitness

**Sovereigntist Victory**: Venezuela exited ICSID; no new BITs signed; investment arbitration shifted to domestic courts (controlled by executive).

**Fitness Costs**: Foreign direct investment collapsed (-90% from 2008-2018); oil production declined (lack of international technology/capital); economic crisis (hyperinflation, shortages).

### Theoretical Significance

Demonstrates **high Sovereignty Phenotype but high fitness costs**: Institutional exit achieved, but economic consequences severe. Contrasts with Ecuador (ICSID withdrawal but later accepted UNCITRAL arbitration) and Bolivia (ICSID exit 2007 but economy more diversified).

**Diffusion Effect**: Inspired Ecuador (2009), Bolivia (2007) ICSID withdrawals; ALBA bloc promoted alternative dispute resolution (never institutionalized).

---

## Case 6: Ecuador ICSID Withdrawal

**Country**: Ecuador  
**Years**: 2009  
**Institutional Outcome**: 1 (Sovereigntist victory, later moderated)  
**Sovereignty Phenotype**: 0.75  
**Globalism Phenotype**: 0.35

### Background and Context

Ecuador denounced ICSID Convention on July 2, 2009 (President Rafael Correa), effective January 7, 2010. Withdrawal followed 2008 Constituent Assembly's Article 422 (prohibiting international arbitration ceding sovereignty to foreign tribunals).

### Phenotypic Competition Dynamics

**Sovereigntist**: Constitutional Article 422, ICSID withdrawal, termination of 16 BITs (2008-2017), Correa's "economic patriotism" rhetoric.

**Globalist**: 12 pending ICSID cases (including Occidental Petroleum $1.77B award, largest against Ecuador), international investor concerns, later acceptance of UNCITRAL arbitration (compromise).

### Selection Pressures

1. **Occidental Petroleum Dispute**: $1.77B ICSID award (2012) validated Correa's anti-arbitration position domestically
2. **Resource Nationalism**: Oil revenues funded Correa's social programs; protecting from investor claims prioritized
3. **Regional Trend**: Venezuela (2012), Bolivia (2007) set precedent; Ecuador part of "Pink Tide" sovereigntist wave

### Outcome and Institutional Fitness

**Mixed Outcome**: ICSID exit achieved, but Ecuador later negotiated BITs allowing UNCITRAL arbitration (2015-2020s under President Moreno). Demonstrates **institutional moderation** when economic costs mount.

**Fitness**: Post-Correa governments (2017+) recognized need for foreign investment; ICSID withdrawal reversed de facto (new treaties allow arbitration, just not ICSID venue).

### Theoretical Significance

Demonstrates **memeplex evolution**: Radical sovereigntism (Correa 2009) moderated to pragmatic sovereigntism (Moreno 2017+). Selection pressure (FDI decline, economic slowdown) drove institutional adaptation.

**Ecuador vs. Venezuela**: Both ICSID withdrawals, but Ecuador avoided Venezuela's collapse by maintaining alternative arbitration access.

## Case 7: Russia's Council of Europe Exit

**Country**: Russia  
**Years**: 2022  
**Phenotypic Expression Score**: 5  
**Institutional Outcome**: 1 (Sovereigntist victory)  
**Sovereignty Phenotype**: 0.95  
**Globalism Phenotype**: 0.05

### Background and Context

Russia withdrew from the Council of Europe (CoE) on March 16, 2022, one day after CoE suspended Russia's membership following the February 24, 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Russia simultaneously exited the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) jurisdiction.

### Phenotypic Competition Dynamics

**Sovereigntist**: Military invasion (Ukraine), withdrawal from CoE/ECtHR, Constitutional Court rulings asserting Russian law supremacy (2015, 2020), "Sovereign Democracy" ideology.

**Globalist**: ECtHR judgments against Russia (10,000+ pending cases, including Yukos $2.6B award), CoE membership commitments, ECHR Article 2 (right to life) violations documented.

### Selection Pressures

1. **Ukraine Invasion**: Incompatible with CoE membership; expulsion inevitable
2. **ECtHR Judgments**: Russia refused to enforce multiple rulings (Yukos, Navalny, others)
3. **Geopolitical Isolation**: Post-2014 Crimea annexation; CoE membership burden without benefits

### Outcome and Institutional Fitness

**Complete Sovereigntist Victory**: Russia exited all CoE institutions; no human rights oversight; domestic courts supreme.

**Fitness Costs**: International isolation, war crimes prosecutions at ICC (Russia also withdrew 2016), economic sanctions, diplomatic ostracism.

### Theoretical Significance

Demonstrates **exit as extreme phenotypic expression** (score = 5). Comparable to Brexit (institutional exit) but driven by military conflict vs. democratic referendum.

**Diffusion**: No other CoE members followed Russia (unlike earlier ICSID withdrawals in LatAm). Demonstrates **limits of memetic diffusion** when selection pressures diverge (European democracies vs. autocracy).

---

## Case 8: Philippines ICC Withdrawal

**Country**: Philippines  
**Years**: 2019  
**Phenotypic Expression Score**: 4  
**Institutional Outcome**: 1 (Sovereigntist victory)  
**Sovereignty Phenotype**: 0.85  
**Globalism Phenotype**: 0.20

### Background and Context

Philippines withdrew from the International Criminal Court (ICC) on March 17, 2019 (effective March 17, 2020), following ICC Prosecutor's decision to open preliminary examination into President Rodrigo Duterte's "War on Drugs" (30,000+ extrajudicial killings alleged, 2016-2019).

### Phenotypic Competition Dynamics

**Sovereigntist**: ICC withdrawal announcement (March 2018), Duterte's rhetoric ("hypocritical Western courts"), domestic investigations blocking ICC jurisdiction claims.

**Globalist**: ICC Rome Statute obligations, NGO pressure (Human Rights Watch, Amnesty), UN Human Rights Council condemnations, ICC preliminary examination (opened February 2018).

### Selection Pressures

1. **Drug War Defense**: Duterte's campaign centerpiece; ICC threat to his core policy/legacy
2. **Political Support**: 80%+ approval ratings (2016-2018); public supported drug war
3. **Anti-Colonial Narrative**: ICC portrayed as neo-colonial interference; resonated with nationalist sentiment

### Outcome and Institutional Fitness

**Sovereigntist Victory**: Philippines exited ICC; Duterte avoided prosecution during term.

**Post-Duterte (2022+)**: New President Marcos Jr. did not rejoin ICC, but cooperates with ICC investigation (retroactive jurisdiction 2011-2019). Demonstrates **institutional persistence** beyond populist leader.

### Theoretical Significance

Demonstrates **personalist sovereigntism**: ICC withdrawal tied to individual leader (Duterte) vs. institutional competition. Contrasts with Brexit/Poland (structural sovereigntism) and Russia (geopolitical sovereigntism).

**Regional Context**: First Asian ICC withdrawal; no diffusion effect (no other Asian members exited). Philippines's later ICC cooperation shows **memeplex instability** when tied to single leader.

## Case 9: Brazil Belo Monte Dam

**Country**: Brazil  
**Years**: 2011-2016  
**Phenotypic Expression Score**: 3  
**Institutional Outcome**: 1 (Sovereigntist victory)  
**Sovereignty Phenotype**: 0.70  
**Globalism Phenotype**: 0.40

### Background and Context

Brazil's Belo Monte Dam (Amazon River, 11,000 MW capacity) faced opposition from indigenous communities and Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR). Brazil defied IACHR's 2011 precautionary measures ordering dam suspension, arguing national development priorities and sovereignty over natural resources.

### Phenotypic Competition Dynamics

**Sovereigntist**: Dam construction continued despite IACHR order, Brazilian government denounced IACHR "interference," President Dilma Rousseff defended sovereignty over Amazonian resources.

**Globalist**: IACHR precautionary measures (April 2011), American Convention on Human Rights obligations, NGO advocacy (Amazon Watch, Survival International), indigenous rights (ILO Convention 169).

### Selection Pressures

1. **Energy Demand**: Brazil's growing economy required electricity; Belo Monte critical for industrial development
2. **Indigenous Rights vs. Development**: Tension between global human rights norms and national economic priorities
3. **IACHR Legitimacy Crisis**: Brazil (and other LatAm states) increasingly skeptical of IACHR's authority

### Outcome and Institutional Fitness

**Sovereigntist Victory**: Dam completed (2016), operates at full capacity (2019+), IACHR measures ignored.

**Globalist Adaptation**: Brazil remained in OAS/IACHR system but asserted "margin of appreciation" for development decisions. IACHR did not escalate; accepted Brazil's position.

### Theoretical Significance

Demonstrates **selective compliance**: Brazil did not exit inter-American system (unlike Venezuela OAS withdrawal 2019), but defied specific IACHR order. Shows **institutional selectivity** as intermediate phenotypic strategy.

**Diffusion**: Emboldened other LatAm states to challenge IACHR (Argentina, Ecuador); contributed to IACHR reform debates (2013-2015).

## Case 10: Hungary Media Law Dispute

**Country**: Hungary  
**Years**: 2010-2012  
**Phenotypic Expression Score**: 3  
**Institutional Outcome**: 0 (Globalist victory - Hungary amended law)  
**Sovereignty Phenotype**: 0.50  
**Globalism Phenotype**: 0.60

### Background and Context

Hungary's 2010 Media Law (Act CIV) centralized media regulation under government-appointed National Media and Infocommunications Authority (NMHH), raising concerns about press freedom and EU law compatibility. European Commission launched infringement procedure (2011), leading to Hungarian amendments (2011-2012).

### Phenotypic Competition Dynamics

**Sovereigntist**: Fidesz government's Media Law (2010), Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's rhetoric defending "Hungarian media model," national sovereignty over cultural/media policy claims.

**Globalist**: EC infringement procedure (2011), OSCE media freedom concerns, European Parliament resolution condemning law (March 2011), EU Audiovisual Media Services Directive compliance requirements.

### Selection Pressures

1. **EU Membership**: Hungary's economic dependence on EU (net recipient of structural funds); expulsion risk (though never formally threatened)
2. **International Reputation**: OSCE, Council of Europe, press freedom NGOs scrutinized Hungary; "illiberal democracy" label emerging
3. **Domestic Opposition**: Hungarian journalists, civil society protested; international attention amplified domestic dissent

### Outcome and Institutional Fitness

**Globalist Victory**: Hungary amended Media Law (2011, 2012) to address EC's three main concerns (data protection, media registration, content regulation). EC closed infringement procedure (March 2012).

**However, Partial Sovereigntist Resilience**: Amendments were minimal; NMHH remained government-controlled; media freedom continued to decline (2012-2025). Demonstrates **formal compliance with continued substantive non-compliance**.

### Theoretical Significance

Demonstrates **early-stage illiberalism** (2010-2012) before Hungary's full "rule of law crisis" (2018+). Shows EU's **initial leverage** through infringement procedures, but limited effectiveness without economic sanctions.

**Hungary vs. Poland Comparison**: 
- Hungary amended law (2012) vs. Poland defied CJEU (2021-2023)
- Timing matters: Pre-Brexit EU less willing to confront members; post-Brexit EU developed conditionality mechanisms
- Both cases exhibit **institutional resilience**: Formal compliance masks continued illiberal consolidation

## Conclusion: Cross-Case Patterns

### Geographic Patterns

**Europe (Cases 2, 3, 7, 10)**:
- Challenges to supranational institutions (EU, CoE)
- Rule of law / democracy concerns central
- Economic leverage (EU funds) matters (Poland) but insufficient alone (Hungary)

**Latin America (Cases 1, 5, 6, 9)**:
- Resource nationalism predominant
- Rejection of investment arbitration (ICSID) / human rights courts (IACHR)
- Regional "Pink Tide" memetic diffusion (Venezuela → Ecuador → Bolivia)

### Phenotypic Expression Patterns

**Score 5** (Brexit, Russia CoE): Complete institutional exit; no compromise  
**Score 4** (Botnia, Poland, Venezuela, Philippines): High phenotypic expression; sustained conflict; significant consequences  
**Score 3** (Greece, Brazil, Hungary): Moderate competition; one side eventually yields or compromises

### Institutional Outcome Patterns

**Sovereigntist Victories** (Brexit, Poland, Venezuela, Ecuador, Russia, Philippines, Brazil): 7/10 cases  
**Globalist Victories** (Greece, Hungary): 2/10 cases  
**Mixed Outcomes** (Botnia): 1/10 case

**Pattern**: Sovereigntist memeplex wins more often in selected cases, but at varying fitness costs (Venezuela high costs, Brazil low costs).

### Selection Pressure Patterns

1. **Economic Crises** drive sovereigntism (Greece failed due to euro dependency; Venezuela succeeded but collapsed)
2. **Resource Nationalism** enables sovereigntism (Venezuela, Ecuador, Brazil)
3. **Democratic Legitimacy** matters (Brexit referendum vs. Poland judicial reforms)
4. **Economic Interdependence** constrains sovereigntism (Greece euro, Poland EU funds, Hungary EU funds)
